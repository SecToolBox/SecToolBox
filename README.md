# CyberToolbox  
*Where Bits Meet Brains*  

A clandestine collection of digital lockpicks for the modern cyber-nomad.  

## Why This Exists  
In a world where 90% of CTF players secretly Google "hex to ASCII" at 2 AM, we decided to build a hideout for the tools you pretend you never needed.  

## What's in the Black Box?  
- **OSINT Whisperer**: Track digital ghosts without leaving crumbs.  
- **Web Exploit Garage**: Break things elegantly (we promise it's legal).  
- **Crypto Vault**: Encrypt, decrypt, and occasionally question your life choices.  
- **Forensic Lens**: Find what wasn’t meant to be found.  

## Quickstart  
1. Clone this repo like you’re stealing the Declaration of Independence.  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CyberToolbox.git
